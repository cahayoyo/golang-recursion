# Recursion in Golang

## Recursion Uses Stack
```
All recursion uses stack
It will call function, and returning function 1 by 1 through the stack
```

## Types Of Recursion
1. Tail Recursion
  - All operation will performed at calling time only, no operation at returning time
  - Position in last statement
2. Head Recursion
  - Operation will performed at returning time
  - Position in first statement
3. Tree Recursion
  - Recursive Function calling itself more than one time
  - Time Complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>)
  - Space Complexity is O(n)
4. Indirect Recursion
5. Nested Recursion
